## Queer Fans Deserve Data

How can data help with the current state of queer representation in the media? LezWatch.TV, an online database and queer entertainment news site, was started by two TV-obsessed lesbian web developers with the intention of cataloging and documenting queer female, transgender, and nonbinary characters, and their corresponding shows from TV, web, and streaming media. With that data, statistics are calculated on the state of international queer story representation, with the goal of providing free and easy access to information on the best shows with queer characters and stories in the genres fans want to see. LezWatch.TV is a story of fandom, passion, code, and the desire to see fair, equal, and positive representation for people like us on television.
